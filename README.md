# Object-Oriented-Programming
Unit Notes: Object Oriented Programming   

**Lesson 1:**        

**Class:**    
- Contains attributes       
  - Human class: race, gender, age, height, hair color, weight, etc.       
- Contains actions        
  - Human class: eat, drink, sleep, talk, regulate breathing and temperature (automatic), etc.       
- Everything is contained and are objects within the class (for the examples, they are objects of the human class)         

**Object:**  

**In Computer Science (CS):**       
- Object can be a variable, a data structure, a function, or a method; therefore, a location in memory having a value that can be referenced by an identifier
        
**In Object Oriented Programming (OOP):**          
- An object in OOP is an instance of a class where this object can be either a variable, a function, a data structure or a combination of such       

**The OOP Paradigm:**          

**Object Oriented Programming (OOP):**           

- Programming practice to design modular reusable software systems        
- OOP designs programs with creation of **Objects**        
- Focuses on the definition of data rather than the input → processing → output logic            
  - OOP vs procedure-oriented programming
- Goal: create an object that we can define and provide functionality to solve problems           

**Conceptual Differentiation:**           

**Procedure-Oriented:**              
- Human may require: calculations, logical evaluations, complete repetitive tasks, database        

**OOP:**           
- Human Object: What's their name? What's their address? What functions can this object have?               

NOTE: OOP focuses on how to manipulate the data of the object rather than the logic required to manipulate them             

**Objects:**             
- **Object**: A combination of data and functional code. This is because real-world objects have states and behavior.              
- **RECALL THAT AN OBJECT IS AN INSTANCE**
- **States:** The characteristic, measurable data of an object
- **Behavior:** The available functionality of the object (what can it do?)
- Object’s Data → called: attributes
- Object’s Code → called: methods
