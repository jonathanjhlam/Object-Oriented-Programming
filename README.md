Unit Notes: Object Oriented Programming   

Lesson 1:        

Class:    
- Contains attributes       
  - Human class: race, gender, age, height, hair color, weight, etc.       
- Contains actions        
  - Human class: eat, drink, sleep, talk, regulate breathing and temperature (automatic), etc.       
- Everything is contained and are objects within the class (for the examples, they are objects of the human class)         

Object:  

In Computer Science (CS):       
- Object can be a variable, a data structure, a function, or a method; therefore, a location in memory having a value that can be referenced by an identifier
        
In Object Oriented Programming (OOP):          
- An object in OOP is an instance of a class where this object can be either a variable, a function, a data structure or a combination of such       

The OOP Paradigm:          

Object Oriented Programming (OOP):           

- Programming practice to design modular reusable software systems        
- OOP designs programs with creation of **Objects**







An approach that focuses on the definition of data rather than the input → processing → output logic (OOP vs procedure-oriented programming)
The goal is to create an object that we can define and provide functionality to solve problems
